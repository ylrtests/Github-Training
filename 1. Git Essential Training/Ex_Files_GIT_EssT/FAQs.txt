Q: In the Chapter 10 movie "Configuring the command prompt to show the branch," 
when I type the function "__git_ps1," I do not get the expected result.

A: The function "__git_ps1" was recently moved to a new file, .git-prompt.sh, as 
described here: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/af31a456b4cd38f2630ed8e556e23954f806a3cc">https://github.com/git/git/commit/af31a456b4cd38f2630ed8e556e23954f806a3cc</a>.<br /><br />We will update the video. 
In the meantime, you may do the same steps you do for .git-completion.bash, but a second time using ".git-prompt.sh" as shown here:

Q: When I use the code the instructor advises in the above video 
("git config&#8232;--global user.name "Nelda Street"), I still get an 
"Illegal Instruction"&#8232;error. I have OS 10.6.8. Am I doing something wrong?

A: The current installer version of git isn't compatible with older Mac OS versions.

Or to use the version of git that comes with Xcode, or to use homebrew to install git instead.</div><div id="pastingspan1">http://superuser.com/questions/697144/installed-git-not-sure-how-to-get-it-working</div></blockquote>



The prompt code has been moved out of the completion code and into its own file.
